<h6>My favourite activity is taking photographs</h6>

<p>
Since my childhood i have been interested in photography and i owe this to my father.<b> He was the 
one who taught me how to use a camera and how to point and shoot</b>. I remember him always taking 
pictures of us as a family and later on the evenings we would all sit down together and watch the 
pictures he had taken. <b>I identify photography as my hobby</b>, specially when i travel. If i had to 
describe my style of photography, i would call it <b>landscape photography</b> because they get me 
out in <b>nature shooting landscapes forces you to get outside and find the beauty around you</b>
